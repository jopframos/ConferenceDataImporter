2015/02/12|11:00|12:00|Auditorium||Keynote: "On the State of Software Engineering"|Dr. James T. Kirk|Software has been made. Software is still being made. Software will be made. That is a certainty. What is not a certainty is how the software will be made. Right from the start of the programmable device availability, the complexity of the software development has been increasing, reaching a current complexity so large that a single developer can no longer completely understand the workings of one simple system. We have to question ourselves: how can we, mere humans, cope with that growth in complexity and still develop simple solutions?

2015/02/12|14:00|15:00|Room A||Making it Agile|Leonard H. McCoy|Why do development technologies must be heavy, boring and immutable? Learn what you can do about it in this presentation.
2015/02/12|14:00|16:00|Room B||Hands-on: "Classroom SCRUM implementation... Been there, done that!"|Amanda Grayson|Want to learn it? Do it! That's the second best way to learn it. After you finish, teach it to others (and THAT's the best way to learn!).
2015/02/12|15:00|16:00|Room A||Making it Lean|Jean-Luc Picard|Keep It Stupidly Simple, so that it can be fast to adapt...
2015/02/13|09:00|10:00|Room A|Design|Architectures and Meta-Architectures|Jonathan Archer|Agile do not mean no planning at all. They will, however, loose sight of the application architecture. Do you want software to do only what the client asks, or do you want to maintain it too?
2015/02/13|09:00|10:00|Room B|Development|Structured, Object-Oriented, Functional... What's next?|Pavel A. Chekov|Languages evolve. Paradigms shift. But that does not mean you can't take advantage of it...
2015/02/13|10:00|11:00|Room A|Design|Meta-Everything|Henry Archer|Why stop on simple abstraction? Abstract your abstractions and build meta-applications so that yoy can generate... even more applications...
2015/02/13|10:00|11:00|Room B|Development|JVM and Scala|Hikaru Sulu|Java is not the only language to use the JVM. In fact, many say that the JVM is the best part of Java. Join us on a "sword train" on Scala, cutting all the edges and see how it integrates with the world's best virtual machine.
2015/02/13|11:00|12:00|Room A|Design|Design Patterns: Solutions for problems that should not exist|Zefram Cochrane|Everyone like patterns. They are repeatable, and therefore, predictable. Design patterns had emerge as solutions for many recurring problems and most are related to Java. So, is Java (the language) the problem? And are the design patterns a solution or are they just a bandage?
2015/02/13|11:00|12:00|Room B|Development|Java 8: Objects meet Functions?|Hoshi Sato|New year, new number, new functionalities. Are they for you?
2015/02/13|12:00|14:00|||Lunch Break||
2015/02/13|14:00|15:00|Room A|Development|Ruby with and without Rails|Porthos (special guest)|Roof, arf, warrooof. Barf roof auuuu.
2015/02/13|14:00|15:00|Room B|Testing|Unit Testing with JUnit|William T. Riker|Testing is like taking a vaccine... Even though there are some who foolishly think they are some sort of conspiracy, the informed ones know that they help you/your code healthy.
2015/02/13|15:00|16:00|Room A|Development|User Interfaces: Swing, GTK, QT, wxWidgets. Which to choose?|Sarek (unpronounceable vulcan)|Look... so many... It's like... "It's full of stars" (2001 Space Oddissey)
2015/02/13|15:00|16:00|Room B|Testing|Acceptance Tests: Is natural language enough?|Spock (unpronounceable vulcan)|How do you test: "If you meet with me, Then you should live long, and prosper"? In this session we'll go from natural language, to repeatable, automatic test. Hope you like your veggies and cucumber...
